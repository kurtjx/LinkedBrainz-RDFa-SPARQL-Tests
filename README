LinkedBrainz RDFa and SPARQL consistency tests
==============================================

@author kurtjx

This is a set of tests written in python to check whether the contents of the
MusicBrainz SPARQL endpoint are consistent with the contents of the MusicBrainz
RDFa.  In a perfect world, such tests would not be necessary but unfortunately
this is not a perfect world :-)
